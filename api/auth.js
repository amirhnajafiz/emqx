/*
The authorizationCode is a key part of the OAuth 2.0 authorization process.
It's a temporary code that's returned to your app after a user successfully authorizes your app.
This code is then exchanged for an access token.
To get an authorization code for Instagram Basic Display API,
you need to implement an OAuth flow involving user authentication through Facebook.

/*
The redirect_uri (redirect uniform resource identifier) is a URI where the user will be redirected after they authorize your app.
It's an endpoint within your application that receives the authorization code or access token after the user grants permission.
For security reasons, redirect_uri should match the one you've set up in your Facebook app's settings
